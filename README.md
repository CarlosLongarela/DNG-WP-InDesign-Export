# DNG-WP-InDesign-Export
Export from WordPress to InDesign or to a HTML file and zip file with used images

This plugin is included in a bigger plugin for DNG Photo Magazine admin, that plugin has its admin menus and other integrations with DNG WordPress portal.

This code is adapted for that portal but you can use it changing id categories, paths for export files (this code don't check it because that task is handled by other plugin part). 

This plugin is made for fotodng.com, feel free to adpat to your WordPress installation and InDesign workflow, if you want CSS for html exported and other files contact me at carlos@longarela.eu
